  {
    question: "What is a temporary / disposable / anonymous mail?",
    answer: "A temporary, disposable, or anonymous email address is a short-lived email account that is generated instantly and on-demand. It allows you to receive emails (such as confirmation links, activation codes, or newsletters) without giving away your real, personal, or professional email address, keeping you secure from unsolicited marketing and trackers."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do you need a temporary email address?",
    answer: "Using a burner email lets you download files, register on forums, or test web services without exposing your real identity. This completely blocks spam emails, promotional offers, and tracking attempts from reaching your personal or professional inbox."
  },
  {
    question: "How long are emails kept?",
    answer: "By default, your generated disposable address remains active for 3 minutes. Since we use strictly ephemeral memory storage with zero logs to save on server storage and protect your privacy, all messages are automatically deleted and permanently wiped when the 3-minute timer expires, or when you click 'Delete'. You can easily extend the timer inside the dashboard if you need more time."
  },
  {
    question: "Do emails stay private? Do you read messages?",
    answer: "No, we never read your messages, and we do not store them permanently. All incoming emails are processed in-memory and are irreversibly deleted from our systems when their timer expires or when you manually click the 'Delete' button. Your privacy is 100% guaranteed."
  },
  {
    question: "Where do I see if I've received an email?",
    answer: "All incoming emails are displayed in real-time in the inbox section directly on our homepage. The inbox auto-refreshes every 5–10 seconds, so you don't even need to refresh the page manually."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I change the email address?",
    answer: "You can click the 'Change Address' or 'Refresh' buttons above the address box. This allows you to generate a new randomized email address immediately, or choose a custom username and domain from the dropdown lists."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you recover deleted emails?",
    answer: "No. Once an email address or message is deleted, it is permanently and irreversibly purged from our routing servers. It cannot be recovered by you, us, or anyone else."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference of disposable mail from the usual email?",
    answer: "Usual email addresses are permanent, require personal details (name, phone number) to register, and are linked to your real identity. Disposable mail is completely anonymous, requires zero registration, lasts for a limited duration, and leaves no footprint."
  },
  {
    question: "How to send email?",
    answer: "Our service is strictly an inbound-only mail utility. We do not allow sending emails. This security measure prevents malicious actors from abusing our domains to send spam or phishing emails, maintaining high inbox deliverability rates for your incoming verifications."
  },
  {
    question: "Is temp mail safe?",
    answer: "Yes, temporary mail is highly secure for registering on non-sensitive sites (forums, downloads, trials). However, we strongly advise against using it for highly confidential personal portals, such as online banking, health accounts, or primary utilities, where you might need long-term access to retrieve password resets."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have browser extension?",
    answer: "Yes! Check our browser extensions to generate randomized temporary email addresses with a single click directly from your browser toolbar. Safely shield your privacy on any sign-up page without leaving your current tab."

2. **Account Metadata**: Your real email, payment details, and geographical access points are linked.
3. **Usage Frequency**: When and how long you code.

### How to Use a Temporary Email for Cursor

    content: `Fortnite remains a powerhouse of online gaming, but with popularity comes risk. Epic Games accounts, often holding premium skins and digital assets, are constant targets for phishing schemes, database credential stuffing, and hacking attempts.

### The Risks of Using Your Real Email on Gaming Forums
Most gamers sign up for unofficial Fortnite forums, skin trackers, trade portals, or V-Bucks calculators using their primary email addresses. This is dangerous because:
- Unofficial gaming sites have weak security databases and get breached frequently.
- Scammers crawl these databases to send highly convincing phishing emails pretending to be Epic Games support.
- Your email is sold to advertisers targeting the gamer demographic.

### Why Burner Mail is Perfect for Fortnite Extensions
When you register on third-party gaming platforms, use a temporary email address. Your Epic Games account remains associated with your secure primary email, while the auxiliary tools and stats trackers are kept safely isolated. If a tracking forum gets hacked, your core Epic Games account stays completely safe.`

### The Importance of Identity Isolation in Dating
By linking your real email to Tinder or dating support forums:
1. **Cross-Site Tracking**: Advertisers use your email to link your dating preferences with your LinkedIn or shopping history.
2. **Unwanted Discovery**: Coworkers or contacts may find your dating profile via contact list syncs.
3. **Phishing Targets**: Dating notifications are commonly spoofed by scammers to drop malware onto your device.

### Securing Your Dating Profile
Using a temporary disposable email is a clean way to keep your dating activity completely independent. You can complete your verification code through our service, activate your account, and rest assured that no advertising agency can link your late-night swipes with your professional workspace.`

### The Anatomy of a Roblox Scam
Scammers build convincing web pages offering free in-game currency. To redeem the fake reward, children are prompted to input their Roblox username and email. Once collected, these emails are used to send sophisticated password-reset links that compromise their accounts.

### Best Practices for Parent-Child Privacy
1. Keep the primary Roblox account registered under a parent's secure email.
2. For all unofficial forums, gaming groups, skin creators, or fan clubs, mandate the use of temporary email.
3. Teach kids never to input their primary login credentials on third-party sites.`

- **Avoid Listening Bias**: If you want to play ambient background tracks, kid's lullabies, or study noise without ruining your personalized algorithms (like Discover Weekly), use a burner profile.
- **Test Family Plans**: Evaluate premium plans or test streaming quality on a new speaker system without linking your primary profile.
- **No Marketing Spam**: Stop Spotify and its advertisers from spamming your main email with concert tickets and subscription upsells.`

When looking for roles, your email address is shared across job boards, resume aggregates, and recruiting databases. This inevitably leads to a barrage of spam, fake recruiting campaigns, and marketing lists.

### How to Use Disposable Mail for Networking
By using a temporary email address to communicate with preliminary recruiters or registering on unfamiliar job portals:
- You filter out low-quality automated recruiters.
- Your personal email is kept safe until you sign an NDA or establish a trusted direct relationship with a company.
- You avoid being added to permanent cold-outreach databases.`

In this tutorial, we outline how to pair virtual private networks (specifically trusted providers like 7vpn) with disposable email addresses from our service to secure your web activity from all vectors of corporate and state surveillance.

### Step 1: Secure Your IP with 7vpn
A VPN encrypts your active data stream, masking your real IP address and physical location. This prevents your ISP and websites from logging your geographical location.

### Step 2: Clear Your Footprint
Even if you use a VPN, signing up on websites with your real email leaks your identity. By generating a disposable temporary mailbox on our service, you eliminate the final piece of the tracking puzzle.

### Step 3: Combined Browsing Workflow
1. Activate your VPN tunnel on your device.
2. Launch a secure or incognito browser.
3. Open our page to generate your transient, short-lived email.
4. Complete your sign-ups and link confirmations safely, knowing you have left zero traces behind.`
